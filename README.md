# Android Studio MVP Template

This is an Android Studio template for MVP. 
This is really helpful.

It is inspired by [u2020-mvp-android-studio-template](https://github.com/LiveTyping/u2020-mvp-android-studio-template) and follows [Antonio Leiva's MVP implementation guide for Android](http://antonioleiva.com/mvp-android/). It also implements presenter surviving orientation changes following [Antonio Gutierrez's article](https://medium.com/@czyrux/presenter-surviving-orientation-changes-with-loaders-6da6d86ffbbf).

> If you are looking for the first version, without presenter survival, please download the [first release](https://github.com/benoitletondor/Android-Studio-MVP-template/tree/1.0). Note that version 2 (current one) is not compatible with version 1.

Here's the hierarchy it follows:

```
com.company.app
    +-- injection
    |   - ActivityScope
    |   - AppComponent
    |   - AppModule
    |   - FragmentScope
    |   - MainViewComponent
    |   - MainViewModule
    +-- interactor
    |   +-- impl
    |       - MainViewInteractorImpl
    |   - BaseInteractor
    |   - MainViewInteractor
    +-- presenter
    |   +-- impl
    |       - BasePresenterImpl
    |       - MainViewPresenterImpl
    |   - BasePresenter
    |   - MainViewPresenter
    +-- view
    |   +-- impl
    |       - BaseActivity
    |       - BaseFragment
    |       - MainActivity
    |   - MainView
    | - YourApp
```

## Prerequisites

You must use [Dagger 2](http://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection and `AppCompat` for annotations and base classes.

## Installation

#### For Mac:

- If you have a standard Android Studio installation:

Just run the install script at the root of this repository:

```
./install.sh
```

- Manual installation:

Just copy all 3 directories `MVPFragment`, `MVPActivity` and `MVPBoilerplate` to `$ANDROID_STUDIO_FOLDER$/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities/`

#### For Windows:

Just copy all 3 directories `MVPFragment`, `MVPActivity` and `MVPBoilerplate` to `$ANDROID_STUDIO_FOLDER$\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities\`

## How to use

#### 1. Generate base boilerplate

First of all, create the base hierarchy and classes using `MVP Boilerplate` from the **root package folder**. This needs to be done only once per project:

![Create MVP Boilerplate](static/createboilerplate.png "Create MVP Boilerplate")

It will generate an `App` class that you should use as your Application, an `ActivityScope`, `FragmentScope`, `AppModule` and `AppComponent` for injection, a `BaseActivity`, `BaseFragment`, `BasePresenter`, `BasePresenterImpl` and `BaseInteractor`. It also generates the common classes for presenter persistancy (`PresenterFactory` and `PresenterLoader`).

> Be sure to use the generated `App` as your Application into your manifest!

#### 2. Create your first activity

Then you can create a new `MVP Activity`. It will create:

- An `Activity`
- A layout for your Activity
- A `Component` and a `Module` for Dagger 2 injection
- A `View` interface for your Activity
- A `Presenter` interface and default implementation class
- An `Interactor` interface and default implementation class for your model

> It's important that you **create it from the root package**, otherwise it will re-create the whole MVP hierarchy under your subpackage which is not what you want.

## Presenter lifecycle (Important!)

Your presenter will be kept across activity re-creation on orientation changes using a [Loader](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/loaders.html). For more details about how its done, read [Antonio Gutierrez's article](https://medium.com/@czyrux/presenter-surviving-orientation-changes-with-loaders-6da6d86ffbbf).

It means that:

- You want to be sure to update your view state on each `onStart` call of your presenter since your view may have been destroyed and re-created since last `stop`.
- You should use the `viewCreated` parameter of the `onStart` method to know if the view has been created or re-created (e.g. following a screen rotation). This boolean will be true only if the view has just been created so **if it's `true` you should update your view according to the presenter's state**.
- You should *not* stop your background operations on the `onStop` method (things like HTTP calls or database connection) since your view may still be available (on the next `onStart` call).
- You **must** stop all background operation on the `onPresenterDestroyed` method. When this method is reached, it means that your view is completely destroyed and will not be re-created later.

You should also be **very** careful about:

- Since the presenter is loaded asynchronously by a `Loader`, it means that it's not available before the view actually started. So **the `mPresenter` variable can (and will probably) be null when your activity or fragment starts** (you should **not** call your presenter directly into `onCreate`, `onStart` or `onResume` methods).
- To avoid leaks, your presenter will not keep a reference on your view when this view is stopped. It means that **your view is guaranteed to be available from the `onStart` method to the `onStop`**. It also means it will be `null` outside of this scope.

> To ensure those last 2 points, `mView` and `mPresenter` are annotated with `@Nullable`, to enforce the check by the linter. It's a good idea to surround all calls with `!=null`.
